CODES OF BASIC RECURSION Repository:

📌 Overview:
This repository contains essential recursion-based programs implemented in Java. These programs demonstrate various recursive techniques, including mathematical computations, searching, and array operations. The repository is useful for students and developers looking to strengthen their understanding of recursion.

📂 Programs Included:
1. RecArrSmallest.java – Finds the smallest element in an array using recursion.

2. RecArraySum.java – Computes the sum of all elements in an array using recursion.

3. RecBinarySearch.java – Implements the Binary Search algorithm recursively.

4. RecCountDigits.java – Counts the number of digits in a given number recursively.

5. RecEvenInTwo.java – Finds even numbers within a given range using recursion.

6. RecFactor.java – Determines factors of a given number recursively.

7. RecFactorial.java – Computes the factorial of a number using recursion.

8. RecMultiply.java – Multiplies two numbers using recursion (without using * operator).

9. RecRevTable.java – Prints the multiplication table in reverse order using recursion.

10. RecSumNatural.java – Computes the sum of the first N natural numbers recursively.

11. RecTable.java – Prints the multiplication table of a number using recursion.
